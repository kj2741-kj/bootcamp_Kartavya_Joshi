# Project Performance & Scenario Analysis Report

## Chosen Audience & Rationale

**Audience:** This report is designed for **business stakeholders and decision-makers**, such as portfolio managers, investment committee members, or senior management.

**Rationale:** This audience needs a high-level overview of the results without getting lost in the technical details of the modeling process. They are primarily concerned with the bottom-line impact, the risks involved, and the strategic implications of the analysis. The language is kept non-technical, and the focus is on actionable insights.

## Format Rationale

**Format:** A concise, slide-deck-style report was chosen.

**Why it fits their needs:**
* **Clarity and Brevity:** Stakeholders are often time-constrained. This format presents the key takeaways upfront in an executive summary, followed by clear, annotated charts.
* **Focus on Business Impact:** The report translates statistical outputs (like Sharpe ratios) into business terms (like risk-adjusted returns) and directly addresses the "so what?" question in the "Decision Implications" section.
* **Visual Storytelling:** The charts are organized to tell a coherent story, starting from the risk-return trade-off and ending with the long-term cumulative impact, making the recommendation intuitive and easy to grasp.
